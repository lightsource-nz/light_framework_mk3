the goal of the light framework is to create a C Language-based application framework and build system, which understands the concept of software that runs on the local development machine, as well as software that is targeted to run on some external embedded system, and facilitates testing of embedded applications on local hardware, as well as other complex building and deployment scenarios. light also aims to facilitate the construction of applications and libraries in a modular fashion, and to generally make it easier for developers to create new software projects, and new modules within existing projects.
